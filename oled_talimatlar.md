I notice you're asking me to further develop the instructions for a "Face Plugin" for a Raspberry Pi 5 Robot AI system, and your request is in Turkish ("Bu talimatı dahada geliştir" which translates to "Develop this instruction further").

I'll enhance the instructions with more detailed specifications for each component of the face plugin:

# ================================================
# Enhanced Copilot Instruction for face_plugin
# ================================================
#
# Plugin Name: Face Plugin
# System: Raspberry Pi 5 Robot AI
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# Purpose:
# - Manage 3 Mono OLED SSD1306 Displays (Left Eye, Right Eye, Mouth)
# - Create and display dynamic emotion-based facial expressions in real-time
# - Control WS2812 LED strips for synchronized emotion-based lighting effects
# - Communicate bidirectionally with main AI system through standardized API endpoints
# - Provide a lightweight, responsive dashboard for monitoring and controlling facial expressions
#
# Technical Architecture:
# ================================================
#
# 1. OLED Controller Module (oled_controller.py):
#    - Hardware Interface:
#       * Support for SSD1306 via I2C (primary) and SPI (fallback) protocols
#       * Configurable I2C addresses for multi-display setup
#       * Display specs: 128x64 resolution, monochrome, 3.3V logic
#    - Features:

#       * Authentication and rate-limiting for external access
#
# 6. Dashboard Server (dashboard_server.py):
#    - Web Server:
#       * FastAPI backend for efficiency and async support
#       * Lightweight static files server
#       * WebSocket relay for real-time updates
#    - Dashboard Features:
#       * Real-time face preview with emotion controls
#       * Theme selector and customization tools
#       * Animation player/recorder
#       * System diagnostics (CPU/memory usage, temperature)
#       * Mobile-responsive design for various screen sizes
#       * Dark/light mode support
#
# 7. Main Controller (face_plugin.py):
#    - Core Functionality:
#       * Initialize and coordinate all modules
#       * Configuration management and validation
#       * Error handling and recovery mechanisms
#       * Graceful startup/shutdown procedures
#       * Performance monitoring and optimization
#    - Plugin System:
#       * Standardized plugin API for additional features
#       * Event system for inter-module communication
#       * Logging and diagnostic capabilities

Would you like me to further develop any specific section of these instructions in more detail? For example, I could expand on the emotional expression system, provide example JSON configurations, or develop pseudocode for one of the modules.
